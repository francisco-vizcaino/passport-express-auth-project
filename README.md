# Node.js, Express, Passport, & EJS Authentication System

This is a sample guide on building a basic authentication system where users can register, login, and access a restricted page. This system will also “hash” user passwords upon registration and display user-specific information on the frontend using EJS. The goal is to teach you the fundamentals as to how Node.js works with Express and Passport, and hopefully develop a similar system for your own project. This project is not meant for production use.
